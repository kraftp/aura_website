####Writing a proposal for your organization

One of the first things you will need to do is organize your vision for the organization. Different schools will have different procedures for accepting a new organization and so the first step would be to refer to your respective school’s guidelines. In most cases, the principles detailed below will be helpful for both creating a new organization and for approaching faculty/administrative staff for mentorship and/or financial support. A written proposal is highly encouraged as it will be useful as a guiding document to refer to in your later stages of developing your organization and to show peers/faculty/administrative members you will be approaching for assistance. Drafting a proposal for an organization is no easy task. Your proposal may include one or more of the following items:

#####A mission statement or a statement of purpose.
The principles detailed in your mission statement will serve as the focus and purpose of all the initiatives you plan for your organization. Important questions to address in your mission statement are:

<li><em>Who will your organization serve to benefit?</em>
ex. Undergraduates interested in mathematics/economics, undergraduates interested in the applied sciences, undergraduates in the social sciences and humanities, undergraduates conducting research in any field, etc.</li>
<li><em>What will your organization strive to improve?</em>
ex. Communication between undergraduates interested in conducting research and faculty conducting research, awareness of research opportunities, availability of workshops to help undergraduates improve on research-related skills (public speaking, scientific writing, etc), access to research opportunities for underrepresented minorities, events and programming to enrich undergraduates’ research experience, etc.</li>
<li><em>What is your organization’s philosophy?</em>
ex. To promote a diverse undergraduate community, to foster interdisciplinary connections amongst undergraduates, etc.</li>
<li><em>Need for an undergraduate research association on your campus</em>
When approaching faculty for support of your organization, it is important to articulate the unfilled niche your organization can occupy. If your campus has an undergraduate research office, it will be helpful to discuss the resources that an undergraduate-run organization can offer which an administration-run research office cannot offer as easily. For example, are students at your school looking for peer-level advice from upperclassmen that are conducting research? Or could students benefit from having an undergraduate research association raising awareness of the resources provided by the administration-run research office? If your campus does not have an undergraduate research office, this is a point that may also highlight the need for a centralized undergraduate-run research organization.
In addition, it may be helpful to do some research on your school’s mission as well. Dovetailing your organization’s mission to the mission of the school can be powerful as well, whether it is to promote a well-rounded liberal arts education or to cultivate curiosity.  When discussing the need for an undergraduate research association, it is important that the arguments you make are backed by evidence. Look into statistics relating to research at your university or conduct interviews with fellow students to gain a deeper understanding of the need for your organization.</li>

#####Goals/Proposed Initiatives/Collaborations
This section of your proposal will address the goals mentioned in the mission statement or statement of purpose in greater detail. The structure for this item may vary. One simple way of organizing your organization’s goals is to list your objectives in bullet-point format and address each objective with a proposed initiative.
For example:
<li><em>Promoting research among freshmen.</em> Workshops about getting involved in research will be held during the first few weeks of school. These workshops will target freshmen interested in learning about the research opportunities available to them.</li>
<li><em>Increasing dialogue amongst students and faculty.</em> Small roundtable discussions with a professor over dinner will be organized to facilitate conversations between students and professors every month.</li>
<li><em>Promoting research-related skills.</em> Journal clubs will be held weekly. Journal clubs will be organized in collaboration with the Graduate Student Council. Every journal club will be kicked-off by a graduate student who will discuss tips for reading and comprehending scientific papers.</li>

<p>This section is a great place to highlight your creative ideas for promoting research. In addition, if you have begun discussions with other organizations at your school, this is the place to mention how their assistance could integrate into your initiatives. You may structure this section is other ways as well. If it is more helpful, feel free to create a separate section for initiatives and collaborators.</p>
