So you’ve landed that summer research internship--what next?

Participating in summer research is a great way to augment your college experience, add to your resume, learn new skills, and contribute to an interesting project. Without the class and extracurricular commitments of the school year, the summer months provide a great opportunity for focus and momentum on a research project. However, progress doesn’t come without hard work and planning during the summer months: here are some tips for making the most of your opportunity!
<ol>
<li>
  <b>Set a list of goals you’d like to accomplish during the summer with your research advisor and plan out your experience week by week.</b><br>
  This list can, and should be, ambitious! You will inevitably hit roadblocks that can delay your progress, or reach a point where your work takes another direction than you expected. This is okay! But starting with a list gives you an initial direction to go in and helps you develop a focus for your summer research.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Maintain a stellar lab notebook.</b><br>
This could be one of the most important parts of your research experience. Lab notebooks can be handwritten or electronic. In any case, the key is to make sure your protocols, your troubleshooting, your results, and your thoughts are extremely well documented. If they are not, you could be wasting precious time re-troubleshooting protocols and making sense of what you already did. Having messy notes often leads to messy research.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Maintain communication with your advisor(s) and lab partner(s) throughout your experience.</b><br>
Keep your mentors, advisors and collaborators up to date on what you’re up to! Often they will have advice or ideas that will benefit your project and/or help you learn or improve your skills. Oftentimes, professors and staff are more available in the summer to help than they might be during the school year when teaching can take up their time. Take advantage of this while you can!
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Seek out help when you need it.</b><br>
Advisors and mentors are there to aid you in your research and help you learn. If your direct research advisors aren’t familiar with your particular question, then seek out a professor or researcher who might know the answer. Often professors in other departments of your institution or program might be able to help you, and connecting with researchers in other disciplines is always a great way to learn new skills, make new friends and network with people who could help you in the future. Additionally, if you would like more information or tips on a protocol in a research publication, reach out to the authors! Authors are usually very excited when other researchers read their work. However, be sure to check in with your mentor to determine what aspects of your project you can discuss with other labs, if at all.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Learn about the other projects going on in your program, lab, cohort or department.</b><br>
You can learn new techniques or interesting findings within your field by conversing with your labmates. Asking questions and learning about others’ research might give you a new direction for your own research, or help you learn about a field you’d never experienced before. You can certainly bounce ideas off of your labmates for your own projects, as well.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Write everything down.</b><br>
Keep a notebook for your summer experience aside from your lab notebook, and use it to take notes on anything and everything. Bring it to lab meetings, presentations, and brainstorming sessions. Make lists of people, phenomena, papers to look into. This might help you develop your own ideas about your research, fields of interest, future plans, and anything else that you gain from your summer experience, and will give you something tangible to take with you into your future experiences.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Present your work often.</b><br>
Take every opportunity to talk about your research--with friends (inside and outside your research discipline), colleagues, donors, professors, and anyone else you can think of. It might seem difficult at first to explain what you’re doing to somebody outside your field, but practice makes perfect. In addition, seek out poster sessions, present in lab meetings and take advantage of invitations to present your work--it will help you improve your understanding of your work, help you develop vital public speaking skills, and garner valuable feedback.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Write about your work.</b><br>
There are many ways to do this. Some research programs, jobs, and opportunities might require you to submit weekly summaries of what you’ve been doing. These can be useful in helping you synthesize your daily tasks in the context of your project and help you plan your next steps. You can also keep an abstract or research summary running and update it periodically. Incremental work on writing up your research will save you a lot of stress in the long-run.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Work hard.</b><br>
Take advantage of your work hours, and the ones after work! Summer is a great time to do research, because you have fewer other commitments to worry about. Take advantage of this, and put the energy into accomplishing your goals during the summer because this will improve your project and allow you to learn the most you can. Take advantage of the lack of homework to do some independent homework too--attend research talks at research institutions, use downtime you might have to comb through literature, read about techniques you are less familiar with, and augment your knowledge of your project and its related fields.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Take time to enjoy your experience.</b><br>
Get to know your labmates- they can be great friends and colleagues as you move into future experiences. Participate in fun activities with labmates, professors, fellow members of your program. If you’ve travelled to a new place for your research opportunity, get to know it a little bit by going out to a popular dinner spot, exploring your neighborhood, or participating in popular local activities.
