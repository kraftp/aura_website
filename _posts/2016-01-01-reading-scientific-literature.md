In our pursuit to both comprehend and contribute to science, it is critical to be a strategic reader of scientific literature. Reading original research papers and comprehensive technical reviews is quite different from reading standard prose, and thus require a different skillset. Below, we detail some guidelines that will be useful in gaining a deeper understanding of the science we read.

<ul class="disc">
<li>
<h6>Read the abstract thoroughly</h6>
The abstract is one of the most useful pieces of any paper. By distilling the entire article into one succinct paragraph, a good abstract acts as a mini-version of the entire study by presenting the background of the research question, the methods used to study it, the results observed, and the conclusions deduced. Make sure to pay particular attention to the abstract as you first begin reading a paper.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Note the key terms given under the abstract, and look them up if you are not familiar with them.</h6>
Often times, a paper will include “key terms” below the abstract to let the audience know about concepts that arise frequently in the article and which should be familiar to the reader before proceeding. If you don’t know one of the words, don’t worry – just do a quick search to familiarize yourself with it, and then continue on. The only way to become truly familiar with these ideas is by reading these types of papers.

<h6>Read slowly</h6>
Scientific writing can be intimidating. It is often very dense and difficult to understand. While it is sometimes the result of poor writing, it is more likely that the authors must convey complex scientific protocols and ideas with concise and precise language. Accordingly, it is essential to read slowly enough that you actually understand everything you read. It will be frustrating when you don’t understand things the first time you read them, but again, don’t worry – this happens to everyone! Professional scientists themselves make a habit of reading and re-reading constantly because this is a necessity when working towards a deep understanding of any subject material.

<h6>Highlight important sentences and make notes in the margins</h6>
Because you will be re-reading papers, make your work easier the next time around by annotating the article the first time you read it. Whether you read online or on a hard copy, highlight important passages. For this to actually be useful, try not to highlight too much (this may not save you much time on the re-read) or too little (this may lead to omission of important ideas). The “right” amount of highlighting is different for everyone, so find what suits your particular style and needs best. Also, it’s great to write out summaries, notes, and questions in the margins as you go – when you’re re-reading, you’ll thank yourself for thinking through these details the first time.
</li>

<h6>If you are doing an in-depth literature review, make a separate document that summarizes the key points from each paper you read</h6>
If you are putting together a detailed review, or simply trying to gain a thorough understanding of a field, it’s tremendously useful to organize your knowledge as you go by creating a separate document. This makes it much easier to keep track of everything as you continue reading. You could use a simple document with article summaries, tables that separate articles on different sides of the scientific argument, or idea-webs that show connections between different papers. Experiment with different techniques to see what works best for you.

<h6>Pay special attention to figures!</h6>
Figures are absolutely essential to any paper. Frequently, when researchers are just skimming papers, they will read the abstract, analyze the figures, and skim through the conclusions. Knowing this, authors pack a lot of critical information into these figures. Many times, if you can understand the figures, you can understand the main arguments of the paper.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Re-read your highlighted sections and notes in the margins</h6>

As we mentioned earlier, it’s important to re-read. We recommend reading over your highlights and notes in the margins right after you finish your first thorough reading, and then again when you are studying multiple papers together or putting together a review.
</li>

<h6>Be able to explain the paper to someone else</h6>
Mentors have often told us that you really understand a topic when you can teach it to someone else. If you can confidently explain the main ideas of a paper out loud to someone else, or even in the mirror, you have a good grasp of the subject. It is especially important to practice explaining the figures!
</li>
<li>
<h6>As you read, keep a written list of questions regarding things you don’t understand, and then ask for guidance</h6>
We won’t understand everything on every paper the first time we read it. A tremendous advantage to being a student is that we are constantly surrounded by people who can explain the difficult ideas to us. To make the most of your resources, be organized and keep a written list of questions as you read to have in hand when you approach a professor or research mentor to clarify complicated issues – it’ll ensure that you understand everything, and give some structure to your discussion.
</li>

<h6>Use a paper’s references strategically</h6>
It may be tempting to ignore that long list of references at the end of each paper, but this list can actually be extremely useful to both students and experts of a field. Most obviously, if you are just beginning your learning, the citations point you toward further relevant reading – in particular, the papers cited in the introduction will often place the research question in context. Check out these papers to further develop your background knowledge. On the other hand, it can be useful to see what other papers have cited the paper you just read. If you have access to online databases through a university library, you can do this using Web of Science from Thomson Reuters. By using both of these techniques, you can see what came before and after the paper in hand, and continue in whatever direction is most appropriate.
</li>

<h6>Note a paper’s credibility</h6>
We always want to make sure we are reading papers that contain reliable information, rigorously peer-reviewed by experts in the field. One approximate measure of a paper’s credibility is the “impact factor” of the journal in which it is published. Higher tier journals have higher impact factors, which means that many authors routinely cite papers published in these journals, and the work is widely known. Another factor is how many people cite the actual paper itself, where again you can use Web of Science – more citations typically translates to higher credibility. Additionally, you can search for other work done by the lead authors or primary investigators; if they are prolific and well-respected in their field, chances are you can trust what you read. Don’t limit your assessment just to the paper you are reading – you should also use these same credibility checks on the key references mentioned in the paper to ensure that the article’s foundational claims are well-supported, too. As you are building your knowledge base, it may be useful to give more weight to articles that are published in better journals, as they are considered more groundbreaking and ultimately become more widely-discussed. There is no perfect measure of credibility and scientific findings are often contested, but keep these things in mind as you read the literature widely and deeply. It is always beneficial to exercise healthy skepticism while reading any scientific article.
