When planning an event, it is very recommended that you think early on about funding. Student groups require funding for various reasons, whether it is to rent locations, host keynote speakers, or provide food at events. Securing funding for you student group varies greatly from school to school, but there are still a few key aspects about funding that you should be aware of.

Before applying for funding, you will first need to review the eligibility requirements for obtaining funding from the university. Eligibility generally includes being a registered student group at your university and having a valid constitution.

When asking for funding for a particular event, the leaders of the student group must have a detailed budget of the expenses of the event before they can approach funding sources. The budget should include a list of all of the items, the cost of each item and the necessity of each item.

Once your student group is eligible for funding and has a detailed budget for an event, you can start looking for funding sources. Each school may have different approaches for student groups to obtain funding, however there are a few funding sources that most schools have. Student groups can obtain funding from academic departments, the student body, other student groups and off campus organizations. Academic department usually sponsor student groups that either have an affiliation with them or are organizing an event that involves the department. The student body in many universities has access to funds and can sponsor any registered student group. Other student groups can fund your student groupâ€™s event by co-sponsoring the event. Outside organizations can sponsor your event, however some universities have strict regulations regarding funding sources outside the university. When asking for funding from a source, remember to explain why the funding is necessary, why the source should fund your student group and where the funding is going.

After receiving funding from a specific source, make sure to give credit to the sponsor during your event and keep the receipts from any expenses as a record of your purchases.
