We at AURA believe that research is an integral component of a successful undergraduate education, but we also realize that the notion of research as an undergraduate student, fresh out of high school, can seem intimidating—be it due a lack of prior experience, worries of balancing classes with research, or simply not knowing how to get started. We also realize that the word “research” often conjures up images of white lab coats and colorful test tubes, but our definition extends well beyond this stereotype. Research is, simply, a creative activity with a scholarly motivation. It is about taking something that fascinates you—whether that’s a microscopic villain, a period in art history, or an Enlightenment novelist—learning more about it, and ultimately contributing your very own piece to it.  Each year, hundreds of thousands of students do just that by participating in undergraduate research. We have compiled these guidelines to help you get started on this exciting journey:

<ul class="disc">
<li>
<h6>Identify your interests</h6>
As you take classes throughout your undergraduate career, allow your mind to wander. Brainstorm for ideas, and take note of a few potential topics of interest. Attend university lectures, speak to faculty members, and Google, Google, Google.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Search for a list of potential mentors</h6>  
Browse online, using scholarly keywords along with the title of the institute where you would like to work. Most academic profiles use the designation of PI, or Principal Investigator, to reference the person in charge of a research group, and some even state whether or not the PI is searching for student collaborators. It is also helpful to remember that these potential mentors can be PhD’s, Medical Doctors, a previous professor, or even an attending that you have shadowed.

<h6>Compose a carefully drafted email</h6>
Let your prospective mentors know that you are interested in their work. In the body of the email, we recommend discussing four items: your academic background, your personal research interests, any relevant post-undergraduate educational plans, and a research project or scholarly topic that you may both be interested in discussing. Attach a copy of your curriculum vitae and, finally, ask for a time to meet with them. Professors are often busy and can take up to a week (and sometimes longer!) to respond. For this reason, we recommend contacting at least 3 at a time. You may not hear back from the first 5. You may not hear back from the first 10. The key to finding an undergraduate research opportunity is to remain intensively persistent.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Meet with your mentor</h6>
Once you have secured a meeting time, be prepared to discuss you and your future mentor’s expectations in depth. Questions often revolve around previous, relevant experiences (if any), your role in the conception of the research question, the number of hours per week you are expected to spend working on the project, and any expectations for the final product (e.g. Senior Thesis, conference presentation, or a published paper). It is also important to carefully read their website beforehand, as you may be asked about your interest in ongoing projects.
