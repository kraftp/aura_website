There are many ways to run a journal. In this guide, we will present a number of options that have worked well for different journal groups.

First, you will want to think about your vision for the journal and set the parameters for your publication. Some questions to consider include: Will each issue be themed? <sup>[1]</sup> How often do we want to publish? Will this be a print or digital journal, or will we make it available both in print and online? Who is our audience? Answering these questions early is important because it will make later decisions about resource allocation and submission garnering easier.

Of the questions suggested above, the most consequential is that of digital v. print publication. Print media has great value in its physicality; the visceral experience of a print journal’s heft and freshly printed smell cannot be understated. However, a print journal has a cost per page that digital media doesn’t have. If your goal is to publish lots of content frequently, online publication may be the way to go. You’ll save a lot of money on printing and may save time on layout. If you want the best of both worlds, you may choose to print a “best-of” issue once or twice in your financial cycle and publish content more frequently online.

Of course, your audience will help you select which option is best for you. A print journal can only reach a finite number of people, but a digital journal can only reach people with internet access. If your audience is the undergraduate student body, digital may be fine because computers on campus are ubiquitous. However, if your goal is to reach a broader community, you may want to consider the population who won’t be able to read your work if it’s put online.

If you choose to publish online, invest in a web domain. Often times, universities will have web domains set up for student groups, but if this is not the case at your university, set aside $15-20 from your budget every year to maintain a unique web domain for your publication. It’s a cheap way to insure a decent level of legitimacy for a new publication being curated by twentysomethings.

Once you’ve set all the appropriate parameters for the journal itself, you will want to set the parameters for your organization. Some questions to consider include: How often do we want to commit to meeting? Will we read submissions during meetings or personal time? How will we select reviewers? What positions do we need in the group besides editors?

When choosing how frequently to meet, consider how often you want to be publishing and how you plan to divide responsibilities among the group. At a minimum, a group should meet once before every publication to choose submissions for publication and determine layout. This group may consist of all members, or specialized subsets of members depending on how you organize the group. Some basic positions you will want covered include:

<h6> Editor-in-Chief:</h6> You will want one or two people to cover this position. The Editor(s)-in-Chief direct the journal’s affairs. They may make executive decisions about what content is published, request meetings, meet with publishers, assist in coordinating publicity events, or make final decisions about layout. The best Editor-in-Chief is a person with good leadership who knows at least a little about every part of the publication process (writing, research, layout, publishing, etc.) and who has a vision for the journal.

<h6>Editors / Reviewers:</h6> With the Editor(s)-in-Chief, these people select submissions that are good for publication. You want reviewers who are proficient in producing the type of submission that is submitted. For a literary fiction, you want reviewers with writing backgrounds. For sculpture photography, you want reviewers with sculpting backgrounds. For chemistry abstracts, you want reviewers with chemistry backgrounds. At the very least, you will want research journal reviewers with research backgrounds and arts journal reviewers with arts backgrounds. You may have a group of regular reviewers, or you may solicit reviewers on an as-needed basis from people that you know with the appropriate specialized knowledge. Both of these models are common, the former more common among arts journals and the latter more common among research journals. These editors may submit their selections to the Editor(s)-in-Chief individually or in a group, depending on the convention that works best for your organization.

<h6>Layout Editor:</h6> The responsibilities of the layout editor and the skills necessary for the position depend greatly upon whether the journal will be print or digital. For print journals, you will make the best use of time and emerge with the best product by using specialized software like Adobe InDesign. <sup>[2]</sup> With such software, you can expect layout editor(s) to work about 20 hours putting together a 30-50 page publication. This time estimate can vary greatly depending upon the degree of standardization in layout across articles (i.e. two columns per page, every page v. two columns plus pop-out quotes and a triangle shaped photograph every third page) and the number of uniquely formatted pieces (i.e. e.e. cummings poems). For print journals, it’s best to give a layout editor two weeks to put an issue together prior to publication. For digital journals, this timeline may be shorter because online layout is even more automated than layout software and is held to fairly minimalist standards due to American bandwidth restrictions. Keep in mind that your layout editor holds great responsibility for the success of your publication. A beautiful journal is more likely to be read. The better your layout editor, the better journal you will publish.

<h6>Public Relations / Social Media Coordinator:</h6> For some organizations, these two roles are fulfilled by the same person; in other groups they are divided, and the Social Media Coordinator takes on additional web manager responsibilities, such as the maintenance of the group website. The PR / Social Media coordinator is responsible for soliciting submissions for the journal and raising awareness of group events, such as the publication of new content. At the least, active social media presence should involve two or three posts per week. These posts may be directly related to organization events and deadlines, or they may be more general posts about writing, research, medicine, art, academic life, etc.

<h6>Treasurer:</h6> Like the Editor(s)-in-Chief, the best Treasurer will be someone who knows a little about every part of the publishing process. This person will need to be able to clearly articulate why your journal need funds for anything from a web domain to an InDesign subscription to print publication. They will need to work closely with the Editor(s)-in-Chief and be well in tune with the needs of the group. Print publication is significantly more expensive than digital publication, and many university treasuries encourage student groups to publish digitally. However, print publication can be more valuable than digital publication for certain audiences, so being well informed of publishing company options and their estimates and articulating the benefits of those costs is crucial to gaining the funds necessary for publication.

After setting up organizational scaffolding, you’ll want to start garnering submissions. This step can be one of the most difficult for new or small publications depending on how you go about it. You’ll need to decide whether or not you will provide feedback to writers. <sup>[3]</sup> Additionally, since your organization is not The Indiana Review or Science, you will likely need to navigate the quantity v. quality paradox. <sup>[4]</sup>

The strongest strategy for gaining submissions involves many tactics. The easiest tactics include maintaining an active social media presence, creating Facebook events for submission deadlines and publication dates, and hanging posters across campus. However, the most effective tactic is emailing the secretaries of relevant departments. Depending on the submission pool that you accept, this task may include searching out the addresses of secretaries in various departments across institutions or it may be as simple as emailing your own university’s secretaries. We advise you to email the department secretary rather than the department head because department heads often have many more responsibilities than responding to emails. One of the secretary’s core responsibilities is handling the forwarding of general emails to relevant parties, so they will be able to forward your call for submissions to all chemistry majors or English majors-- whatever the case may be.

Here are two examples of what that email may look like:

######Notes

<br>
<sup>[1]</sup> The answer to this question can either be decided upon after receiving submissions, i.e. “what can we make with what we’ve got?” or it can be determined before making the call for submissions, i.e. “please send us pieces about family.”
<br><br>
<sup>[2]</sup> InDesign is a moderately expensive software but is well worth the money for the product it can produce. Often times, campuses will have software like InDesign installed on at least a few computers, perhaps in art buildings or the room used by the campus newspaper. If this is not the case, consider petitioning for funds to purchase a copy of InDesign to install on a computer to which your organization will have regular access. Additionally, considering the specialized knowledge required to create layouts well in InDesign, you will want to make sure at least one member of your organization knows how to use the software or has the time to learn. Alternatively, layout can be done in Microsoft word, but will double the time and frustration accrued over the course of publication. Keeping this information in mind is important when deciding whether to publish in print.
<br><br>
<sup>[3]</sup> Within the realm of literary and arts journals, it’s common practice to assume that if a piece was submitted, everything is as the artist intended it. Suggestions and copy-editing are not the journal’s responsibility, and a typo or poor resolution photo submission can be grounds for immediate rejection, regardless of the quality of the work otherwise. However, research journals often work with authors to polish pieces for publication if the original research is good.
<br><br>
<sup>[4]</sup> This conundrum occurs when you want to publish a 30 page journal, but you only receive 40 submissions, 20 of which are unworthy of publication. Print journals have a weightier decision to make in this matter, given the great expense of publishing in print at all.
