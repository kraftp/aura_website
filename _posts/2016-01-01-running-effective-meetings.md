Your enthusiasm, passion and leadership skills have helped you become an officer in your student group. As a student group officer, you will be expected to fulfill certain responsibilities. One of these responsibilities includes running meetings.

Meetings will generally reflect the success of your group. A well-prepared and facilitated meeting will strengthen your group, whereas a disorganized meeting will make it difficult for the group to advance and get closer to its objectives.

While meetings vary between different organizations depending on the type of group, the number of members and mission of the group, there are still many fundamental guidelines to help you run an effective meeting. These guidelines can be divided into three groups: before, during and after the meeting.

<h4> Before The Meeting </h4>
</div>

A well-planned meeting can make the difference between a good and a bad one.
The following bullet points highlight some standards for planning effective meetings:
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<h6>Define the purpose of the meeting</h6>
Meetings take time and effort to plan and attend. It is necessary to have a valid purpose for the meeting in order to motivate members to attend and to make them understand the importance of having this particular meeting. As the leader of a group, you will need to avoid useless meeting as some members have other commitments.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Inform all of the members of the group about the meeting day, time and place.</h6>
Choose an appropriate meeting day, time and place. If possible, avoid changing the meeting specifications in order to limit any complications. Members are more likely to attend meetings that have been planned in advance and that do not change in time, location or date.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Prepare an agenda for the meeting.</h6>
An agenda will keep structure to your meeting. The following is a basic outline of an agenda:
  <ul class="square">
    <li>Attendance</li>
    <li>Review of previous meeting</li>
    <li>Announcements</li>
    <li>Committee reports</li>
    <li>Old and new business</li>
    <li>Action items</li>
    <li>Comments and questions</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="sectiontitle">
<h4> During The Meeting </h4>
</div>

Having a structure to your meeting will help you run the meeting smoothly and productively.
Here are some tips to run effective meetings:

<ul class="disc">
<li>
<h6>Review and follow the agenda.</h6>
It might be a good idea to print the agenda and hand it to the members of the meeting. This will help the members understand the structure of the meeting.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Start and end the meeting on time.</h6>
Showing that you value other people’s time will earn you a lot of respect. Even if the meeting starts late, you should still end it on time and go over any unfinished business during the next meeting.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Keep track of the discussion during meeting.</h6>
It is a good idea to keep a record of the meeting to look back on for information. You should appoint another member to take notes during the meeting or take them yourself.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Encourage group discussion and feedback.</h6>
You will have a better conversation when multiple people are collaborating on an idea. Furthermore, the decisions that are made as a result of the collaboration will be of a higher quality. Members of the meeting will also feel like they are making an impact on the group.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Avoid digressions.</h6>
Although group discussions are valuable, they can still lead to unproductive commentary. It is your responsibility to keep the conversation focused on the topic of the meeting. Keep in mind not to be disrespectful to other members when trying to avoid digressions.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Summarize the key points of the meeting.</h6>
Remind all of the members of the main points of the meeting and of the action items for the next meeting.
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<div class="sectiontitle">
<h4> After The Meeting </h4>
</div>

While the actual meeting may be over, there are still a few more tasks to do to ensure the success of the meeting:
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<h6>Follow up on action items.</h6>
Make sure that all of the members understand what their task is and that they perform their action items on time.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Put any unfinished business on the agenda for the next meeting.</h6>
As was mentioned before, there may be topics that were not covered during the meeting due to a shortage of time. Make sure to put these topics in the agenda for the next meeting.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Deal with any problems that had occurred during the meeting with other members.</h6>
Problems that arise during meetings should generally be dealt with after the meeting in order to minimize digressions during meeting. These problems should be dealt with delicately and wisely. Once a problem has been resolved, highlight ways for improvement.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Give appreciation to members for their hard work.</h6>
As a leader of your group, you should listen to the other members of the group and show appreciation in members’ ideas. Giving recognition for productivity will also motivate members to work a lot on tasks.
</li>
</ul>
