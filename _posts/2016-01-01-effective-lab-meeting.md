<h4> Prepare </h4>
</div>
Write out your presentation and read it aloud. Afterwards, condense it into very short bullet points ranging from one word to a small phrase per topic. Each bullet point is a trigger but not a script. Practice your presentation out loud once or twice with these bullet points. For further fluidity, try repeating the same procedure after cutting down the bullet points into even more concise and general phrases. There are many effective methods of preparation and it takes time to figure out your system. Just remember not to rely too heavily on notes, stay directed, and be concise.

<h4> Know your Audience </h4>
</div>
Move from big pictures, to technicalities, back to big picture. Even though your audience is scientific, make your presentation accessible to as many levels as possible. Don’t forget the whys and the relevance. Conversely, don’t rush through or oversimplify the procedural details. Know that you don’t need to have all the answers. Informed questions are equally valuable. Use your lab group as a second pair of eyes. Your lab meeting is a great time to troubleshoot and fine-tune your procedures, remove extraneous variables, and modify an approach. It is also a great opportunity to practice relating your material to lab mates with drastically different research experience, to ensure that the value of your presentation doesn’t rely on understanding every detail of the scientific discussion. Most importantly, take pride in your research. Your lab members belief in the future of your project begins with your presentation attitude.

<h4> Confidence </h4>
</div>
Even though you are likely speaking to an older audience with more research experience, speak loudly, clearly, and with conviction. Treat it the same way you would a class presentation. That means dressing well and motivating yourself the same way you would as if it were graded. But remember, just because it is a formal presentation doesn’t mean you have to leave behind your personality.
