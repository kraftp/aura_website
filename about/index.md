<h4> Our Mission </h4>
</div>

The Association for Undergraduate Advancement (AURA) strives to facilitate communication about research between undergraduate researchers across the world. We believe connection and dialogue is the core of a fulfilling research experience. To this end, we seek to develop programs and platforms that allow undergraduates from any field and anywhere to share research advice, experience, and opportunities with each other.

<h4>Our Goals</h4>

<li>To open up channels of communication between undergraduates who are in the process of creating or who are integrally involved in an undergraduate research association on their campus</li>
<li>To develop a comprehensive listing of undergraduate research opportunities for the summer and term-time throughout the world</li>
<li>To develop a database of laboratories students can reach out to for research opportunities</li>
<li>To provide advice relating to various aspects of the research process in the form of written guides and/or videos</li>
<li>To showcase opportunities for undergraduates to present their research</li>
<li>To help undergraduates planning notable nationwide or international events advertise those initiatives to a wider audience</li>

<h4>Our History</h4>
</div>

In January 2015, student leaders of undergraduate research associations across 11 university campuses gathered at Harvard University to take part in the National Collegiate Research Conference (NCRC), organized by the Harvard College Undergraduate Research Association (HCURA). NCRC 2015 marked the launching of the first series of Steering Committee Meetings for Undergraduate Research Leaders. The inaugural 2015 meetings allowed motivated undergraduate researchers interested in creating or developing an undergraduate research organization on their campus to meet each other in person. Fascinating discussions about how we might find more effective ways to form productive networks of college researchers across the world led to the birth of the Association for Undergraduate Research Advancement (AURA). AURA is an ongoing collaborative effort amongst undergraduates who are determined to form an international network of undergraduate researchers to facilitate important discussions about undergraduate research. We are committed to developing materials and resources that will be helpful to other undergraduates interested in research.
