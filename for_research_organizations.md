####Welcome!

Congratulations! Realizing the need for an undergraduate research community is the first step to creating one or joining one. You may not know exactly what your association or club will look like just yet, but with a little time, brainstorming, and dedication, you will be well on your way. The following is collection of resources written by students who have built and lead their own research communities on their respective campuses. These guides are intended to familiarize you with initiatives that have been successfully employed at other schools. While the circumstances at each college campus are different, we hope these initiatives can serve as starting points in your brainstorming of ideas specific to your campus. 

If you still have questions after reading the following pages, please feel free to [contact us](/contact_us). AURA would be happy to help you start an undergraduate research association at your school.
