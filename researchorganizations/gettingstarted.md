title: Getting Started in Five Steps
---

Research universities are exciting hubs of discovery and innovation. Undergraduates who are curious about pursuing deep questions across the sciences and/or humanities could gain valuable experience working with a faculty member. However, while faculty are often pursuing thousands of fascinating projects and universities offer research programs and immersion experiences, the landscape of resources can be difficult to navigate. Whether the choices are endless and overwhelming or whether the resources are scarce, certain college campuses could benefit significantly from a student-run <b>Undergraduate Research Association (URA)</b>. These organizations can take on many roles and differ depending on the needs of the student body on each campus. They may provide a community for young researchers, offer mentorship programs, organize faculty talks and journal clubs, liaison between the student body and campus administrators, organize conferences, provide skill-based workshops--countless possible URAs exist, so developing the right URA for your institution can be a challenge. Below are some important considerations for students interested in creating and leading one.

<br>
<div class="sectiontitle">
<h4> Step 1: Do Your Research </h4>
</div>

Ask yourself: what need will an URA fulfill on my campus? This question is made of smaller questions:
<ul class="disc">
<li>
  What is my institution’s unique need for a student-run research organization?
</li>
<li>
  How do the different parts (faculty, administration, students) of our institution have different needs? What are they?
</li>
<li>
  What information, events, and programming can my URA provide to fulfill their needs?
</li>
</ul>

Because each college campus is different, you may need to consider other questions as well.

#####People and Groups to Contact

<ul class="disc">
<li>
<h6>Co-founders</h6>
Find and build a team of driven students who share your vision for an URA. Since you will likely be spending a lot of time with your teammates, your relationship with them will be an influential part of your URA-building experience. My 4 co-founders were the most important part of starting YURA.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Students</h6>
Individual students. Are they having trouble accessing research resources? Do they know what university research resources are offered? Do they feel supported when they are looking for professors to work for? Keep in mind that students are the most important part of your URA — these are the people you will be serving — so strive to understand the diversity of the students you will support.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Student Organizations</h6>
Connect with (historical, present) organizations that my URA can work with or learn from. Determine what resources they provide. Figure out how to differentiate your URA from the other student organizations on campus.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Administrators</h6>
Staff at campus research office (if any), Deans, Presidents, Research Provosts. Administrators have an understanding of your institution and its bureaucratic processes. This information may guide your URA to its perfect niche in the university and help you consolidate that niche.
From administrators, seek:
<ul class="circle">
<li>introductions to faculty, administrators, and students who can help your cause</li>
<li>guidance with the logistics of running a student organization, like registration, documentation, and acquiring university funding</li>
<li>information about research resources your university already offers </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Faculty</h6>
Department chairs, PI’s, professors. Think of faculty as the Senate to the students’ House of Representatives. Seek to understand faculty needs for your URA: do they want a more streamlined version of taking on students for their research projects? Would they like to have more mentoring opportunities? Would they be interested in leading a journal club or giving talks to undergraduates, without dealing with the logistics?
<br>
Additionally, as a more permanent part of your institution, faculty can support your URA even after students graduate. Find faculty who believe in your vision, are willing to discuss and comment on new initiatives you have in mind, and who can reach different groups of undergraduates on campus.
</li>
<li>
<h6>The Association for Undergraduate Research Advancement (AURA) </h6>
Reaching out to AURA will connect you to other students across many university campuses in the US and Canada who have gone through the same process you have. This guide will link to other AURA guides relevant to starting your URA so you can learn from the experience, success, and failure of other URA’s.
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<div class="sectiontitle">
<h4> Step 2: Fund your URA </h4>
</div>

After you’ve determined the purpose and initiatives of your organization, it’s time to secure funding. Funding may come from several different sources:
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<h6>Your College/University</h6>
Many institutions have funds for student organizations. If available, institutional funding may be available through an application process. To help your case in requesting funding, it is important to put forth a strong proposal for your organization's work. Keep in mind that your institution may have limits on how much funding may be devoted to a new student organization, restrictions on the uses of that funding, and bureaucratic limitations that prevent funding from being delivered when you need it. For more information, refer to Mimi Yen of Harvard University’s guide to draft an URA proposal. Additionally, Habib Khoury of Stanford University has written an excellent guide to securing funding from your university (link).
</li>
<li>
<h6>Individuals and Sponsorships</h6>
Some examples might be biotechnology companies, test prep companies, or any big corporation that sponsors educational initiatives. The right sponsor can fund your URA in a very timely manner. Additionally, sponsor funds may have fewer strings attached, so your URA may have more flexibility in allocating those funds. The catch is that sponsor funds are very difficult to secure, making it extremely important for you to identify good reasons for them to fund your URA. Do your research and determine whether these sponsors might want to participate in a career fair, give a presentation to your organization’s members, have access to resumes of undergraduate researchers on your campus, or something else in return for a sponsorship.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Corporate and Government Grants</h6>
Advantages: Generous amount of funding, More spending discretion than institutional grants
Disadvantages: Requires extensive preparation; for example, incorporation and acquirement of 501(c)3 nonprofit status
How to secure funding: requirements v ary; refer to your particular grant agency
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<div class="sectiontitle">
<h4> Step 3: Campus Outreach </h4>
</div>

You know what resources your URA will provide; you have the funding to realize this vision. It’s time to deliver your URA to your institution.

Share your URA’s initiatives and goals with:
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<h6>Faculty and Administrators</h6>
Send an email to or set up an in-person meeting with associated faculty and administrators who have helped you along the way. Thank them for their help and update them on your plans. Keep in touch with them and be sure to let them know of your upcoming events. Invite them or feature them in your events as speakers or mentors, if possible. Politely ask your faculty and administrative supporters to help your URA by providing funding, space, or by spreading the word. If your supporters are professors, ask if they’d be willing to post a PowerPoint slide of your URA or allow you to make a short pitch at the beginning of their classes.
</li>
<li>
<h6>Students</h6>
Reach out to the student body through social media, existing mailing lists, campus flyers. Ask faculty, administrators, or department heads to forward your publicity emails to relevant groups on campus. Have your URA members spread the excitement through word of mouth. And don’t forget to reach out to underclassmen who are just starting on their research journey!
</li>
<li>
<h6>AURA</h6>
If your URA is offering a  public event or if your university is offering a research program to students across the US, contact AURA to get the word out amongst our partner schools.
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<div class="sectiontitle">
<h4> Step 4: Build the URA team </h4>
</div>

To determine the size and profile of your team, ask yourself questions like:
What functions have me and my team performed these past months?
Which functions should we expand on in the future?
How many new team members do we need working on each of these functions?
What skills do we need to run our programming successfully?

Once you have a loose idea of how you want the new team to look, bring in personnel with the 3 Step Recruitment Process:

Recruitment Fair
The recruitment fair is an opportunity for prospective team members to understand how they will work in your URA. It helps to get the word out about your URA to other undergraduates. Look for students who share your vision and who are genuinely interested in being an active part of the organization. Ultimately, it’s the quality and not quantity that matters when it comes to the executive team. Personally contact students who you believe can contribute to your URA.

Application
Strive to write an application that will help you determine:
the skills your applicants can contribute to the team
what they are looking for from the experience
whether they have the time or work ethic needed to fulfill the responsibilities of their position. Be cautious of taking on members who already have a lot of commitments on their plate.

Interview
This process should help you learn more about the applicant’s personality, their ability to work with others, and their application answers. This should also be a time to answer any questions the applicant might have about your URA’s culture or goals. While interviews don’t always tell you everything about an applicant, it can help confirm your thoughts about their written application.

<div class="panel">
<h5>YURA's Recruitment</h5>
Yale’s response to YURA was overwhelming — within 5 months, our events and resources had reached >1,500 undergraduates. Your URA will grow, but you still only have 24 hours in your day. It’s time to bring in a bigger team!
<br><br>
YURA decided to build a team of 3 co-presidents overseeing 4 committees:
<ul class="disc">
<li>Development — guiding the future growth and continuity of YURA through fundraising, research, and documentation</li>
<li>Media — sharing the public face of YURA through social media, newsletters, and tech presence</li>
<li>Outreach — growing long-term relationships with student organizations, faculty, and administrators</li>
<li>Programming — planning and organizing YURA events throughout the year</li>
</ul>
</div>


<br>
<div class="sectiontitle">
<h4> Step 5: Repeat </h4>
</div>

Decide on the right time scale for repeating the cycle of Research, Fund, Outreach, Recruit. Potential time scales include:
A semester
An academic year
A calendar year
Take advantage of opportunities to grow your URA within your school. As you Research, Fund, Outreach, and Recruit, grow not only your URA’s reach but also its benefits to existing members. Remember that your existing members are the foundation on which all growth is built. It is important to program events for your team to get to know and learn from each other.
